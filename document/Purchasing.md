# Purchasing

Here's the list of products that you have to purchase.

## ADX Controller (1,840\$~2,398\$)

The most basic product 
You can buy from [here](https://yuancon.store/controller/adx)

## Monitor (323\$~799\$)

You must buy a monitor to play it

The following must be satisfied.
- Size : 43 inch
- Thickness : equal or thinner than 6.4cm

Here's recommended products you can choose
My personal recomendation is `Philips 438p1`. The most important part is latency, frame rate is not important as long as it is 60fps.

## PC

The specifications of the original maimai DX board (ALLS HX-2) are same as following.
But ADX Controller's monitor is UHD, so It is recommended to use more powerful VGA.
It is okay to use your current PC.
But it is not recommended to buy intel 12th gen or above. Although maimai supports windows 11 (thanks to segatools), original maimai is running on windows 10. Intel 12th gen or above has big-little core structure, which can cause unexpected performance issue. If you are already using it, just keep using it. This only applies if you want to buy a new computer.

| Part    | Model                     |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| CPU     | i3 8100                   |
| RAM     | DDR4 8GB                  |
| VGA     | GTX 1050Ti                |
| Storage | SSD 128GB + HDD 500GB     |
| OS      | Windows 10 IoT Enterprise |
| Monitor | FHD                       |


## Table

You can buy a normal table, or height-adjustable desk.
You should check your table can support more than 60kg. (49kg cabinet, 10kg monitor)
My recommendation is buy a product that can support more than 70kg.

The reference table size is same as following. (D60 W80 H80)

![](</attachment/image/Reference Table Size.png>)

Here's recommended products you can choose

| Model                                                                                                              | Price  | Size (D, W, H)        | Load Capacity | Note                                   |

## Gloves

Using gloves in maimai is essential. It protects both your hands & cab at once.
There are various type of gloves you can choose.
Buy to your taste.

| Product                                                                            | Price  | Amount    | Durability | Thickness | Note       |

| [Winter Gloves]( Pairs)                                                            | 6.59$  | 4 Pairs   | ?          | Thin      |            |
| [PU Non-Coated Inner gloves](https://item.gmarket.co.kr/Item?goodscode=1895008259) | 13$    | 100 Pairs | Bad        | Thin      | For Korean |

## (Optional) Custom buttons (150$)

The default button is quite playable. However, if you want a better experience, you can choose custom buttons. There are various types of custom buttons available. Here’s a comparison chart, and you can also watch a comparison [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLQwiHrYj9o) made by Jacky's Buttons.

![](</attachment/image/Custom button comparison.png>)

The most recommended option is the Rabbit button, which you can purchase from [here](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=660013732031&skuId=5395223410039&spm=a1z10.1-c.w4004-24097871292.3.37221e09DSieDY). 
Make sure to purchase a special task fee equal to the number of 8 full buttons.

You can buy the official button from [here](https://www.zax.com.au/product/8445-maimai-button-assy). 
However, using the official button with the ADX-Controller has not been tested, and it is quite expensive ($1,012). Therefore, it is not a recommended option.

## (Optional) Card reader (~50$)

You can play maimai without card reader.
But if you want to use multiple cards or fancy-feeling, you can purchase it from [here](https://market.m.taobao.com/app/idleFish-F2e/fish-pc/web/detail.html?id=741425871360).
You should purchase option "including card reader".
Alternatively, [you can make it yourself.](https://github.com/necoarcdotcom/Arduino-Aime-Reader)

## (Optional) Materials for maintenance

### Glass Cleaner

Glass cleaner is the best option to clean touch screen, make it more slippery.
The brand doesn't matter. Use anything.

### EVA Foam Tape 10x1mm

[EVA Foam Tape](https://www.amazon.com/Sponge-Equipment-Adhesive-Waterproof-Thickness/dp/B0C3VJM6Z2) is used to make button less noisy.
Just attach the tape as shown below.

![](</attachment/image/EVA Foam tape example.png>)

### Lubricanting grease

Lubricanting grease is used to make buttons feel more soft & comfortable.
Official's recommendation is [Solvest 248](https://stt-inc.co.jp/en/product-info/grease/), but it is too hard to get from other countries, so using other one is okay.
I recommend a grease that can be squeezed out like toothpaste.

![](</attachment/image/Lubricanting grease.png>)

You can use it by just spreading it to leaf spring like following.
